Text about dog
There are moments in our lives when all the people close to us turn away from us. Or when you come home and there's no one there. The best solution to this problem is a dog.
No one can say how easy it will be for you with this decision, but here you have to think it over.
It's hard with a dog, especially the first days. A dog is the same child that is sick or sad, sometimes you really want to play.
It seems that you took it in vain, did something stupid and hurried. But hurry up if you immediately give it away or throw it away. The love of a dog also needs to be earned.
As soon as you come home, you mentally ask the question, what did he do. If the dog wags its tail and its happy eyes are the first thing you see, then everything that the dog did is no longer important.
A wet nose, a long tongue that tries to kiss you, that's what matters.
With each success of your dog, you become happier. Here the dog understood the command to sit, lie down, brought a toy, does not pull the leash, asks to go to the toilet, and you are happier than he is.
The dog is protection and support. As soon as you see how your dog does not let someone near you or barks if something is wrong, then you have nothing to fear.
Even the smallest puppy will not leave its owner in trouble.
You need to communicate with the dog, you need to love it and endure its antics many times.
But when you suddenly get sick, and your dog does not leave you a single step, then you will understand what it was all for, and that it was all worth it.
Dogs often rescue drowning people, find children, and help in rescue operations. The dog will undoubtedly be your family member and friend.
And how do dogs sit for many days near the place where they were thrown out? They can neither eat nor drink nor move. They are the most loyal and devoted creatures.

Aquarium fish
Aquarium fish are diverse in body shape and color. There are those that can easily fit in a teaspoon, some the size of a child's palm. 
Nature endowed them with different colors - red, yellow, blue, green, blue, white, black, some completely multi-colored: striped, spotted, with neon color.
The same goes for their body shape. Some fish are flat like a leaf, others with round, thick barrels. Some inhabitants of the aquarium have a lush, large caudal fin or a narrow and long one.
Mostly common aquarium fish feed on food of animal origin, although some species eat plants and cannot develop normally without them. However, they also eat animal food from time to time.
The most common food for aquarium fish is dry food, which we buy at a regular pet store.
However, those who wish to diversify the diet of the inhabitants of aquariums should pay attention to small crustaceans - daphnia, cyclops.
They can also be caught in ponds, or you can buy them in specialized stores. If possible, diversify the food base of your pets. For small aquarium fish, bloodworms, enchitrei, coretra are suitable.
They can be easily bred at home.
All aquarium fish have well developed sense organs. Most of the tactile cells are located in the upper layer of the body.
In sturgeon, carp and catfish, they are concentrated in additional organs, such as antennae.

My little fish
Aquarium fish live in my house: goldfish, neons, swordtails, several snails and a small catfish. My parents gave me an aquarium with fish for my birthday.
In the pet store, we buy fish not only special dry food, but also live food - these are tiny crustaceans and worms. I feed them a little three times a day.
The fish live in a large rectangular aquarium. At the bottom of the aquarium is a special soil. And at the bottom there are multi-colored glass pebbles and beautiful shells.
The fish have a large underwater castle and various labyrinths. Real live algae grow in the aquarium, which create the appearance that the fish are in the ocean. By the way, fish also eat live algae, it is good for their health.
For a comfortable life of the fish, the parents bought a special lighting for the aquarium. And an air filter is attached to the back wall of the aquarium.
It simultaneously enriches the water with oxygen and filters it so that it is clean and free of debris. The filter needs to be washed periodically.
About once every few weeks, my dad and I clean the aquarium. This is necessary so that the water does not turn green and is not cloudy.
